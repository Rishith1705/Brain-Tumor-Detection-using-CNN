# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN and Deep Learning,Transfer Learning
Brain tumor classification plays a critical role in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. With the advent of deep learning, transfer learning has emerged as a powerful technique for leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets to solve new tasks with limited labeled data. In this study, we employ the VGG16 architecture as the foundation for our brain tumor classification model. VGG16 is a well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) model that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, making it highly adept at extracting meaningful features from images. By fine-tuning the VGG16 model on a specialized brain tumor dataset, we aim to harness its exceptional ability to discern intricate patterns and discern between different tumor types. Through this research, we seek to contribute to the development of accurate and efficient brain tumor classification models that can potentially enhance diagnostic accuracy and streamline treatment decisions
